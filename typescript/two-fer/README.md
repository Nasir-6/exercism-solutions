# Two Fer

Welcome to Two Fer on Exercism's TypeScript Track.
If you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `HELP.md`.

## What I learnt 
- ```name:string = "you"`` - use of default value here, removes the need to have a conditional print of a different string for when input is empty!!

## Instructions

`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message:

```text
One for name, one for me.
```

Where "name" is the given name.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```text
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

| Name   | String to return            |
| :----- | :-------------------------- |
| Alice  | One for Alice, one for me.  |
| Bob    | One for Bob, one for me.    |
|        | One for you, one for me.    |
| Zaphod | One for Zaphod, one for me. |
